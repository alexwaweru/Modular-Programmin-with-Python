# These are my private notes from Modular Programming with Python

## Chapter 1: Introduction to Modular Programming
This chapter introduces the concept of modules in python as a way of organizing
systems that have grown huge and complex. Modules help keep track of of
classes and functions in your system. The chapter also introduces the concept
of python packages. Packages are a collection of related modules.
I have implemented a school package with student, lecturer, staff, and
course modules.
